# Goose Invasion

This project is a live server that supports an interactive multiplayer game, playable on any device, where users follow a goose from a third-person perspective and can interact with those around them, coded with p5.js and Three.js.

Implemented a personal client and live server with Socket.io and Node.js to host this project and used Blender to model different parts of a 3D goose.
